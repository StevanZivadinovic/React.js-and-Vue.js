  "vizantijski_stil_prvi_deo":"Iconography is an integral part of our Orthodox worship, just like Byzantine music and the divine message of sermons. It is an art of joy and hope. From its depths, it teaches us repentance and obedience, sacrifice, and humility. Byzantine iconography is an art that flourished in Byzantium with the emergence of iconography, mosaics, miniatures, and icons. In the early apostolic times, Christians used painting and decoration for liturgical purposes.",
  "vizantijski_stil_drugi_deo":"During the third century, when the fear of idolatry disappeared, Christians began to paint images of Christ, the Virgin Mary, and the Apostles. Later, they continued to depict events from the Old and New Testaments. It was primarily at the Seventh Ecumenical Council that the theology of the icon was defined. Iconography was not left to the discretion and will of painters but was placed under the supervision of the Church. The development of monastic spirituality during the Paleologian era shaped the content of contemporary iconography. Iconography took on a narrative character, with compositions containing a large number of figures. In modern times, what we know about Byzantine iconography comes primarily from icons preserved after the fall of Byzantium in 1453, which are found throughout Orthodox countries.",
